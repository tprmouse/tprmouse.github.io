The event, titled &#8220;Cyberfest,&#8221; transformed the INJR court into a cyber world filled with joy and fun. The celebration had the full support of INJR&#8217;s partner, Alignmed Brasil.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Feliz Dia das Crian\u00e7as! - Instituto Neymar Jr.\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/-_fudObxtVc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Far beyond the Children&#8217;s Day party, Alignmed Brasil, throughout the year, plays a fundamental role in supporting the progress of the project. For Children&#8217;s Day, the company dedicated itself to providing joy and fulfilling dreams to the children served by the institution. For the company&#8217;s CEO, Dr. Gregory Markarian, \u201cbeing part of the happiness and fulfillment of dreams of the children served by the Neymar Jr. Institute is a truly rewarding and exciting experience. We feel a mixture of joy, gratitude and satisfaction in contributing to this special moment in these children&#8217;s lives.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Alignmed Brasil, social responsibility goes beyond business, extending to the well-being and joy of the communities they serve. The company believes that investing in events and initiatives that benefit children and communities is an integral part of its mission, reflecting its values \u200b\u200bof corporate social responsibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, Alignmed Brasil&#8217;s involvement not only impacts the present, but also positively shapes the future of these children. Through moments of happiness and celebration, children are inspired to dream big and believe they can achieve their goals. Furthermore, events like this contribute to children&#8217;s emotional well-being by promoting humanitarian values, developing social and emotional skills, and encouraging social awareness and active citizenship.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the most rewarding aspect of this involvement is the transformation and positive impact that is possible when you invest in children and their potential. Seeing the smiles and happiness on children&#8217;s faces, seeing them gain confidence and develop skills, all of this is truly rewarding for Alignmed Brasil.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" onerror=\"this.src='https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/image-not-available.jpg'\" src=\"http:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/DSC03646-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17441\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/DSC03646-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/DSC03646-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/DSC03646-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/DSC03646-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/DSC03646-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The students at Instituto Neymar Jr. also received a special Children&#8217;s Day message: &#8220;On this Children&#8217;s Day, we want to celebrate with you all the joy, imagination and energy that makes each of you so special. You are the light that illuminates our world and the promise of a bright future. Never stop dreaming big, because it is in dreams that we find our true strength and inspiration. You are unique, talented and capable of conquering the world.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the participation of Alignmed Brasil, other supporters contributed to the success of the party. The music was provided by DJ Luan Pantel, whose infectious beats combined perfectly with the mirrored dance floor and dazzling lighting. Adding rhythm to the party, we had the dance groups Braza Play, Point da Dan\u00e7a and Endorfina, as well as the talented instructor Jorge Alloy. They brought incredible moves, ensuring everyone was in tune with the rhythm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The celebration also featured an electrifying battle of rhymes, bringing talents such as ZKR, Luska Mc, Lucas Poeta, Mc Tubar\u00e3o and Pedro Trick to the stage. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" onerror=\"this.src='https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/image-not-available.jpg'\" src=\"http:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/DSC04085-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17442\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/DSC04085-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/DSC04085-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/DSC04085-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/DSC04085-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/DSC04085-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><br>But the surprises didn&#8217;t stop there! The children were amazed by the appearance of the giant Robot from the Pirouette Clown Group, and enjoyed the snacks provided by the Deby Festas e Eventos food carts. Cooling down the atmosphere, Naturalle Ice Up provided ice creams that quickly became a favorite among the little ones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most innovative attractions was The Movie 13&#8217;s 360\u00ba camera, which gave a modern touch to the party&#8217;s theme. And, of course, we must mention the valuable support of Grupo Faup, which not only provided vouchers for snacks, but also played a crucial role in the visual communication of the event.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The celebration was also attended by the president of INJR, Nadine Gon\u00e7alves, who saw the attractions up close and distributed affection and sympathy to the children and teenagers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" onerror=\"this.src='https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/image-not-available.jpg'\" src=\"http:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/DSC04104-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17443\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/DSC04104-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/DSC04104-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/DSC04104-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/DSC04104-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/DSC04104-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Instituto Projeto Neymar Jr. is especially grateful to Alignmed Brasil and all its supporters for making this Children&#8217;s Day a memorable celebration at the Instituto Projeto Neymar Jr. and for their dedication to providing moments of joy and fulfillment for children.
