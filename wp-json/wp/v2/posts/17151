The auction will include international experiences with Neymar Jr. and other personalities. Among the lots put up for auction are the last Brazil National Team jersey signed by Pel\u00e9 and Neymar Jr., and a poker game with the ace.

The Instituto employs 124 employees, all under the CLT regime&#8221;, he explains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The auction\u2019s first edition, back in in 2017, raised R$2.5 million; the second, in the following year, raised about R$3.9 million. In 2023, the expectation is to exceed last edition&#8217;s mark. According to Vildomar Batista, general director of the Leil\u00e3o do Instituto, the project promises to be a success. &#8220;Neymar is, above all, an example of a citizen and generosity. He could have raised his institute anywhere in Brazil, but chose to do it in the same community where he spent his difficult teenage years, in the same region that later revealed him to the world. And as a result of Neymar and his family&#8217;s efforts, about 3,000 children and 12,000 people can not only dream but also live this reality of a better future. I am very proud to be part of this project&#8221;, highlights Vildomar Batista.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" onerror=\"this.src='https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/image-not-available.jpg'\" src=\"http:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/LEILAO-INJR-4-44-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17148\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/LEILAO-INJR-4-44-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/LEILAO-INJR-4-44-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/LEILAO-INJR-4-44-768x513.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/LEILAO-INJR-4-44-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/LEILAO-INJR-4-44-2048x1367.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Use of resources<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The revenue generated will be used for activities developed by the Instituto Projeto Neymar Jr., which has as one of its objectives to promote social inclusion for children and young people aged 7 to 18, offering original and complementary disciplines to their development, with a primary focus on reducing school dropout rates. The disciplines offered are Arts, General Knowledge, Mathematics, Theater, Spanish, French, Computer Science, English, Reading and Writing and Robotics. In addition to educational development, classes aim to address aspects related to social interaction and interpersonal relationships.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sport is another significant component for the INJR to achieve its goals and fulfill its mission. In addition to working on children&#8217;s motor skills, it is capable of generating relevant and essential learning for human development. The sports offered are Basketball, Football, Futsal, Handball, Board Games, Dance, Judo, Swimming and Volleyball.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to programs for children, the service also aims to include family members in this transformation plan, including vocational courses, lectures, and physical activities, such as hydrogymnastics and weightlifting. All of these campaigns aim to raise awareness on various subjects, increase families&#8217; per capita income possibilities and improve their quality of life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About the Instituto Projeto Neymar Jr.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Instituto Projeto Neymar Jr. (INJR) is a non-profit civil association with the goal of increasing opportunities for children, adolescents and their families in social vulnerability situations. Unveiled back in December 2014, the institution currently serves thousands of children and young people aged 7 to 18, impacting over 12,000 people. The project is funded by its own resources, donations and partnerships with the private sector. The Institute was built on an \u200b\u200b8,400m\u00b2 area and is based in Jardim Gl\u00f3ria, at the city of Praia Grande, a community that faces several difficulties and limitations already experienced by Neymar Jr. and his family, who were residents of the neighborhood. Conceived by the athlete Neymar Jr. and his family, who understood that knowledge and opportunities could transform the lives of countless families, the social project has been operating for eight years in society.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2017, the Institute chose to hold a charity auction to raise funds for the project&#8217;s areas. Additionally, the funds are directed to infrastructure renovations, employee payroll and investment in new projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" onerror=\"this.src='https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/image-not-available.jpg'\" src=\"http:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Visita-Neymar-Jr-2022-96-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17149\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Visita-Neymar-Jr-2022-96-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Visita-Neymar-Jr-2022-96-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Visita-Neymar-Jr-2022-96-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Visita-Neymar-Jr-2022-96-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Visita-Neymar-Jr-2022-96-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About WNB Produ\u00e7\u00f5es<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The auction\u2019s overall direction is held by Vildomar Batista, WNB Produ\u00e7\u00f5es\u2019 CEO, responsible for INJR events such as the Concerto Feliz Natal Brasil Believe, the Neymar Jr. Secret Santa Among Friends, and the Leil\u00e3o Beneficente do Instituto Projeto Neymar Jr.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During this period, WNB also produced content and products for Record, SBT, Band and Fox Sports channels, as well as work outside the country.
