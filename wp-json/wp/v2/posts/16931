We are really committed and we really want to continue the partnership. It is a unique opportunity to really generate value for the people served and this is the most rewarding part of our work as a company\u201d, she says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The HR Director also says that the contact with the children was enriching. \u201cFor me, it was a very special day as a Costa representative. Spending just a few hours here, at the Institute, has enriched me a lot, not just as a professional, but as a person. I just wanted to express my gratitude for the invitation and for being part of this project as important as Instituto Neymar Jr. I am very grateful and very lucky to be part of this fantastic and unique project\u201d, concludes Antonella.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" onerror=\"this.src='https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/image-not-available.jpg'\" src=\"http:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_8111-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16925\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_8111-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_8111-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_8111-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_8111-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_8111-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The visit was led by Altamiro Bezerra, Financial Director of the INJR and, according to him, receiving Costa&#8217;s representatives was an honor. &#8220;Mrs. Antonella came from Italy especially to get to know the project and understand the project, because she has been with us for the last three years. In the first two groups that embarked and now we will have the third. She always participated via videoconference and, this time, she insisted on being present and getting to know the Institute&#8217;s facilities\u201d, says Altamiro.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Solange Leal, the day at the Institute was memorable. \u201cFor me it was a great emotion and a pleasure to be here because I had always heard about the Institute, but I didn&#8217;t know the structure. I am really impacted and moved to see the professionalism, dedication of the people involved and to see the face of our future crew\u201d, she comments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" onerror=\"this.src='https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/image-not-available.jpg'\" src=\"http:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_8358-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16928\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_8358-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_8358-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_8358-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_8358-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_8358-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Costa has been at the Institute&#8217;s side for the last two years, offering to hire students on cruise ships.
