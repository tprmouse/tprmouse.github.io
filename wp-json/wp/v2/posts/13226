Of a professional life, of a promising career. On behalf of the Institute and Neymar Jr&#8217;s family, I want to thank all the students present and the partners\u201d, declares the director.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  Deck4 worked alongside the Institute in organizing the event. The company&#8217;s founder, Fabricio Brito, left an inspiring message for future crew members: \u201cMy message is that they keep dreaming. Dreaming on dry land, dreaming on the high seas. But never stop dreaming. Because they are capable and they will conquer everything they want\u201d, reinforces Fabricio.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"650\" height=\"433\" onerror=\"this.src='https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/image-not-available.jpg'\" src=\"http:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/word-image-13226-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13228\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/word-image-13226-2.png 650w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/word-image-13226-2-300x200.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  Foto: Instituto Neymar Jr.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  Carolina Coelho, CEO of ISMBR, recalled the importance of bringing together family members, young people and the companies responsible for the project. \u201cToday&#8217;s event was a historic milestone, because receiving two company presidents in a single event is a very important milestone, and it means that the company is in a good mood and honored with this project as well\u201d, she says.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  For D\u00e1rio R\u00fastico, President of Central and South America for Costa Cruises, the project is responsible for changing the perspective of the teenagers who will work on board. \u201cThey will start a new path, a path that will take them to fantastic places in life\u201d, says D\u00e1rio.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  The Superintendent of Litoral Plaza Shopping, Martinho Polilo, says that the great importance of this project is the insertion of young people in the job market. \u201cThrough the Neymar Jr. Institute, an opportunity was created.
