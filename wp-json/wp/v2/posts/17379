The children were briefed to draw what \u2018Neymar means to them\u2019 and how he has inspired them, with PUMA then using a mix of different graphics that the children created for the final design.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The children who are featured in the campaign are the children who developed the drawings for the designs, with the timespan between the original drawings and the finalized collection launch being around 18 months. The children were also asked to write their names, which will feature on the insole of the boots and the back neck sign off on the collections t-shirt.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The Institute is very special to me. Since its inauguration in 2014, we have been able to support underprivileged children and their families through sports, education, and healthcare. The Instituto is a place where kids can go after school to learn extra skills that will help shape their future. I am very proud of the team behind this amazing place and the impact we have had on the community, reaching over 10 thousand people. Being able to work with some of the kids on a collection was a beautiful moment for me, and I hope to make them proud when I step onto the pitch wearing the boots, they designed for me&#8221;, said Neymar Jr.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The boot itself is designed with an adaptive FUZIONFIT360 upper which combines dual mesh, stretchy knit, and PWRTAPE to lock down the foot into a snug, supportive fit \u2013 to allow play with or without laces. The engineered 3D textures at key contact zones are optimized to enhance ball grip and control, whilst the dual-density Dynamic Motion System outsole enhances stability, agility, and traction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" onerror=\"this.src='https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/image-not-available.jpg'\" src=\"http:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-07-at-1.43.03-PM-1024x684.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17370\" style=\"width:840px;height:561px\" width=\"840\" height=\"561\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-07-at-1.43.03-PM-1024x684.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-07-at-1.43.03-PM-300x200.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-07-at-1.43.03-PM-768x513.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-07-at-1.43.03-PM-1536x1025.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-07-at-1.43.03-PM.jpeg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As a step toward a better future, the FUTURE INJR football boot is made with at least 20% recycled materials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Neymar Jr. Instituto Collection features items designed by children from the Instituto Neymar Jr. that includes Neymar Jr. training tops, pants, training jerseys, shorts, hoodies, cotton tees, backpacks, baseball caps, shin guards and footballs in kids and adult sizes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Celebrate football and the Instituto Neymar Jr. with the Neymar Jr. Instituto Collection available from September 7<sup>th<\/sup> at PUMA stores and PUMA.com.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" onerror=\"this.src='https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/image-not-available.jpg'\" src=\"http:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-07-at-1.43.04-PM-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17371\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-07-at-1.43.04-PM-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-07-at-1.43.04-PM-300x169.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-07-at-1.43.04-PM-768x432.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-07-at-1.43.04-PM-1536x864.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/www.institutoneymarjr.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-07-at-1.43.04-PM.jpeg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Global sports company PUMA has today launched a special collection with the Instituto Neymar Jr., a community center founded by Neymar Jr. to support underprivileged youth in his old Praia Grande neighbourhood, near Santos.
