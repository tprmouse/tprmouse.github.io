<p>This Tuesday (10), the Instituto Projeto Neymar Jr. held the 2023 Children&#8217;s Day party, specially planned and developed for the children and young people served by the project. The event, titled &#8220;Cyberfest,&#8221; transformed the INJR court into a cyber world filled with joy and fun. The celebration had the full support of INJR&#8217;s partner, Alignmed Brasil.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Feliz Dia das Crianças! - Instituto Neymar Jr." width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-_fudObxtVc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>Far beyond the Children&#8217;s Day party, Alignmed Brasil, throughout the year, plays a fundamental role in supporting the progress of the project. For Children&#8217;s Day, the company dedicated itself to providing joy and fulfilling dreams to the children served by the institution. For the company&#8217;s CEO, Dr. Gregory Markarian, “being part of the happiness and fulfillment of dreams of the children served by the Neymar Jr. Institute is a truly rewarding and exciting experience. We feel a mixture of joy, gratitude and satisfaction in contributing to this special moment in these children&#8217;s lives.&#8221;</p>



<p>For Alignmed Brasil, social responsibility goes beyond business, extending to the well-being and joy of the communities they serve. The company believes that investing in events and initiatives that benefit children and communities is an integral part of its mission, reflecting its values ​​of corporate social responsibility.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Alignmed Brasil&#8217;s involvement not only impacts the present, but also positively shapes the future of these children. Through moments of happiness and celebration, children are inspired to dream big and believe they can achieve their goals. Furthermore, events like this contribute to children&#8217;s emotional well-being by promoting humanitarian values, developing social and emotional skills, and encouraging social awareness and active citizenship.</p>



<p>However, the most rewarding aspect of this involvement is the transformation and positive impact that is possible when you invest in children and their potential. Seeing the smiles and happiness on children&#8217;s faces, seeing them gain confidence and develop skills, all of this is truly rewarding for Alignmed Brasil.</p>

<p>The students at Instituto Neymar Jr. also received a special Children&#8217;s Day message: &#8220;On this Children&#8217;s Day, we want to celebrate with you all the joy, imagination and energy that makes each of you so special. You are the light that illuminates our world and the promise of a bright future. Never stop dreaming big, because it is in dreams that we find our true strength and inspiration. You are unique, talented and capable of conquering the world.&#8221;</p>



<p>In addition to the participation of Alignmed Brasil, other supporters contributed to the success of the party. The music was provided by DJ Luan Pantel, whose infectious beats combined perfectly with the mirrored dance floor and dazzling lighting. Adding rhythm to the party, we had the dance groups Braza Play, Point da Dança and Endorfina, as well as the talented instructor Jorge Alloy. They brought incredible moves, ensuring everyone was in tune with the rhythm.</p>



<p>The celebration also featured an electrifying battle of rhymes, bringing talents such as ZKR, Luska Mc, Lucas Poeta, Mc Tubarão and Pedro Trick to the stage. </p>

<p><br>But the surprises didn&#8217;t stop there! The children were amazed by the appearance of the giant Robot from the Pirouette Clown Group, and enjoyed the snacks provided by the Deby Festas e Eventos food carts. Cooling down the atmosphere, Naturalle Ice Up provided ice creams that quickly became a favorite among the little ones.</p>



<p>One of the most innovative attractions was The Movie 13&#8217;s 360º camera, which gave a modern touch to the party&#8217;s theme. And, of course, we must mention the valuable support of Grupo Faup, which not only provided vouchers for snacks, but also played a crucial role in the visual communication of the event.</p>



<p>The celebration was also attended by the president of INJR, Nadine Gonçalves, who saw the attractions up close and distributed affection and sympathy to the children and teenagers.</p>

<p>The Instituto Projeto Neymar Jr. is especially grateful to Alignmed Brasil and all its supporters for making this Children&#8217;s Day a memorable celebration at the Instituto Projeto Neymar Jr. and for their dedication to providing moments of joy and fulfillment for children. The partnership and commitment to community well-being is truly inspiring.</p>

<p>Global sports company PUMA has today launched a special collection with the Instituto Neymar Jr., a community center founded by Neymar Jr. to support underprivileged youth in his old Praia Grande neighbourhood, near Santos.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" onerror="this.src='https://www.institutoneymarjr.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-not-available.jpg'" src="https://www.institutoneymarjr.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-07-at-1.43.05-PM-1024x576.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-17373" srcset="https://www.institutoneymarjr.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-07-at-1.43.05-PM-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://www.institutoneymarjr.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-07-at-1.43.05-PM-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://www.institutoneymarjr.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-07-at-1.43.05-PM-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://www.institutoneymarjr.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-07-at-1.43.05-PM-1536x864.jpeg 1536w, https://www.institutoneymarjr.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/WhatsApp-Image-2023-09-07-at-1.43.05-PM.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>For this special edition collection and FUTURE INJR football boot, PUMA worked with children from the Instituto to create graphics inspired by the Brazilian idol and celebrate Neymar Jr. for giving back to the community that shaped him. The children were briefed to draw what ‘Neymar means to them’ and how he has inspired them, with PUMA then using a mix of different graphics that the children created for the final design.</p>



<p>The children who are featured in the campaign are the children who developed the drawings for the designs, with the timespan between the original drawings and the finalized collection launch being around 18 months. The children were also asked to write their names, which will feature on the insole of the boots and the back neck sign off on the collections t-shirt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;The Institute is very special to me. Since its inauguration in 2014, we have been able to support underprivileged children and their families through sports, education, and healthcare. The Instituto is a place where kids can go after school to learn extra skills that will help shape their future. I am very proud of the team behind this amazing place and the impact we have had on the community, reaching over 10 thousand people. Being able to work with some of the kids on a collection was a beautiful moment for me, and I hope to make them proud when I step onto the pitch wearing the boots, they designed for me&#8221;, said Neymar Jr.</p>



<p>The boot itself is designed with an adaptive FUZIONFIT360 upper which combines dual mesh, stretchy knit, and PWRTAPE to lock down the foot into a snug, supportive fit – to allow play with or without laces. The engineered 3D textures at key contact zones are optimized to enhance ball grip and control, whilst the dual-density Dynamic Motion System outsole enhances stability, agility, and traction.</p>

<p>Catiane, mother of an INJR student, expressed her happiness at having spent the day with her son: &#8220;It was a very nice and fun day, taking time to be with our children. I was very moved by the songs, songs that make us reflect on when they were little and sang at school. It&#8217;s a very rewarding day to be here.&#8221;</p>



<p>For Marília Melo, also a student&#8217;s mother, the day was remarkable. &#8220;It was very nice to see my children in joy, singing, sharing this very special moment. I was very moved and I loved it. Happy Mother&#8217;s Day to all of you!&#8221;, she said.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="650" height="434" onerror="this.src='https://www.institutoneymarjr.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-not-available.jpg'" src="https://www.institutoneymarjr.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Dia-das-mães-INJR-14.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17205" srcset="https://www.institutoneymarjr.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Dia-das-mães-INJR-14.jpg 650w, https://www.institutoneymarjr.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Dia-das-mães-INJR-14-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></figure>



<p>The INJR had the support of the make-up brand Fenzza, which promoted a special action for Mother&#8217;s Day at the social project&#8217;s barber shop. The celebration had a team of professionals who offered make-up and skincare (skin care) to the mothers, in addition to giving them vouchers for online purchases on the Fenzza website. Sandraelma da Silva, a student&#8217;s mother, declared: &#8220;It&#8217;s wonderful to be here, to have my daughter here and to be able to participate today. For me, it was the greatest gift a mother can have, be sure of that.&#8221;</p>



<p>Cleide Sales, responsible for Fenzza&#8217;s marketing, reinforced the importance, for the brand, of participating in social causes. &#8220;For us at Fenzza and for the whole team that came for this special Mother&#8217;s Day action, it&#8217;s been very important, because we are dedicated to it. We are in favor of several causes, and Mother&#8217;s Day is one of the most important dates of the year. They dedicate themselves so much to others, to their children, and on that day they are setting aside time to take care of their beauty. And it doesn&#8217;t have to be just today, it should be the whole year. I hope that date is extended throughout the year, and Fenzza will be present in their lives.&#8221;, she added.</p>

<p><em>This occasion will auction off international experiences with Neymar Jr. and many other celebrities. The event will take place in June, in São Paulo, and the proceeds will go to projects developed by the entity.</em></p>



<p>The Instituto Projeto Neymar Jr., a non-profit association with the goal of expanding opportunities for children, adolescents and their families in social vulnerability situations, will hold, on June 22, at the Monte Líbano Club in São Paulo, a charity auction to benefit the institution’s socio-educational activities, located in Jardim Glória, Praia Grande, in the southern coast of São Paulo.</p>



<p>In its 3rd edition, the hosts of the night, Neymar Jr. and his family, will receive around 900 guests including athletes, celebrities, influencers, and entrepreneurs. The auction will include international experiences with Neymar Jr. and other personalities. Among the lots put up for auction are the last Brazil National Team jersey signed by Pelé and Neymar Jr., and a poker game with the ace. And, just like the previous edition, each lot will be presented by Neymar Jr., artists and celebrities such as Sabrina Sato, Deborah Secco, Celso Portiolli, Luciana Gimenez, among others.</p>



<p>The event will also feature renowned supporters such as the entrepreneur Roberto Justus, singer Claudia Leitte and hosts Rodrigo Faro and Patrícia Abravanel.</p>

<p>For Altamiro Bezerra, IPNJR’s statutory director, the auction is an important event to unite society around this incredible project. &#8220;During these eight years, we have faced, for example, COVID-19 and despite stopping our activities during this period, all employees had their jobs and benefits preserved. The Instituto employs 124 employees, all under the CLT regime&#8221;, he explains.</p>



<p>The auction’s first edition, back in in 2017, raised R$2.5 million; the second, in the following year, raised about R$3.9 million. In 2023, the expectation is to exceed last edition&#8217;s mark. According to Vildomar Batista, general director of the Leilão do Instituto, the project promises to be a success. &#8220;Neymar is, above all, an example of a citizen and generosity. He could have raised his institute anywhere in Brazil, but chose to do it in the same community where he spent his difficult teenage years, in the same region that later revealed him to the world. And as a result of Neymar and his family&#8217;s efforts, about 3,000 children and 12,000 people can not only dream but also live this reality of a better future. I am very proud to be part of this project&#8221;, highlights Vildomar Batista.</p>

<p><strong>Use of resources</strong></p>



<p>The revenue generated will be used for activities developed by the Instituto Projeto Neymar Jr., which has as one of its objectives to promote social inclusion for children and young people aged 7 to 18, offering original and complementary disciplines to their development, with a primary focus on reducing school dropout rates. The disciplines offered are Arts, General Knowledge, Mathematics, Theater, Spanish, French, Computer Science, English, Reading and Writing and Robotics. In addition to educational development, classes aim to address aspects related to social interaction and interpersonal relationships.</p>

In addition to working on children&#8217;s motor skills, it is capable of generating relevant and essential learning for human development. The sports offered are Basketball, Football, Futsal, Handball, Board Games, Dance, Judo, Swimming and Volleyball.</p>



<p>In addition to programs for children, the service also aims to include family members in this transformation plan, including vocational courses, lectures, and physical activities, such as hydrogymnastics and weightlifting. All of these campaigns aim to raise awareness on various subjects, increase families&#8217; per capita income possibilities and improve their quality of life.</p>



<p><strong>About the Instituto Projeto Neymar Jr.</strong></p>



<p>The Instituto Projeto Neymar Jr. (INJR) is a non-profit civil association with the goal of increasing opportunities for children, adolescents and their families in social vulnerability situations. Unveiled back in December 2014, the institution currently serves thousands of children and young people aged 7 to 18, impacting over 12,000 people. The project is funded by its own resources, donations and partnerships with the private sector. The Institute was built on an ​​8,400m² area and is based in Jardim Glória, at the city of Praia Grande, a community that faces several difficulties and limitations already experienced by Neymar Jr. and his family, who were residents of the neighborhood. Conceived by the athlete Neymar Jr. and his family, who understood that knowledge and opportunities could transform the lives of countless families, the social project has been operating for eight years in society.</p>



<p>In 2017, the Institute chose to hold a charity auction to raise funds for the project&#8217;s areas. Additionally, the funds are directed to infrastructure renovations, employee payroll and investment in new projects.</p>

<p>This Wednesday (22), Instituto Projeto Neymar Jr started another Professional Eyebrow Design Course in partnership with Instituto Mix for parents and students of the social project.</p>



<p>INJR&#8217;s professional training courses aim to provide tools and knowledge through partnerships with Private Companies for the families of students served to increase their per capita income, in addition to being inserted into the job market in an autonomous or effective way.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" onerror="this.src='https://www.institutoneymarjr.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-not-available.jpg'" src="https://www.institutoneymarjr.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Curso-de-designer-de-sombrancelha-Instituto-Neymar-Jr-82-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-17037" srcset="https://www.institutoneymarjr.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Curso-de-designer-de-sombrancelha-Instituto-Neymar-Jr-82-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.institutoneymarjr.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Curso-de-designer-de-sombrancelha-Instituto-Neymar-Jr-82-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.institutoneymarjr.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Curso-de-designer-de-sombrancelha-Instituto-Neymar-Jr-82-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.institutoneymarjr.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Curso-de-designer-de-sombrancelha-Instituto-Neymar-Jr-82-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.institutoneymarjr.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Curso-de-designer-de-sombrancelha-Instituto-Neymar-Jr-82-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The course will cover teaching how to design female and male eyebrows, henna eyebrows, eyebrow waxing with tweezers and threads, and customer service and care.</p>



<p>The administrative director of the INJR, José Benício da Silva Santos, highlighted the importance of the course: &#8220;It will be 3 months of a lot of teaching, very useful for the families that we bring into the project, to combat this indicator that is so precious for the people that is the formation of income.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Instituto Mix&#8217;s pedagogical coordinator, Adriel Oliveira, highlighted the &#8220;Believe in your transformation&#8221; campaign: &#8220;That&#8217;s what we came here to do, transform these people&#8217;s lives through professional education.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eyebrow Design instructor, Camila de Oliveira Machado, explained that the objective of the course is to transform the students into differentiated professionals and make them grow in the area. “It is a profession that can be very good for a woman who needs a lot of flexibility in her schedule and in her day to day life.&#8221;, she completes.</p>



<p>Two students on the course, Luciana Negrão and Ana Carolina Firmino, expressed their gratitude to Instituto Mix and Instituto Neymar Jr for providing this learning and income opportunity. &#8220;The Neymar Institute is to be congratulated for the way it looks at us, from our community. We really need it because we, mothers from the periphery, favelas, which I like to be called that way, mothers from the favelas, have these courses so that we can continue and bring us income&#8221;, said Luciana. For Ana Carolina, the feeling is happiness. &#8220;I feel very happy, very grateful, because it&#8217;s not easy, for us it&#8217;s not easy, and Instituto Mix and Instituto Neymar making this available to us is wonderful&#8221;, she said.</p>



<p>The INJR remains committed to offering opportunities for professional training and increased income for the families assisted by the project. Congratulations to the students and good luck in this new stage!</p>

<p>During the visit, Thiago talked to the young people about his career in sport, participated in language classes and even had fun with the children in futsal and volleyball sports activities.</p>



<p>It was Thiago&#8217;s third visit to the Instituto and, for the Olympic athlete, the project, which is an example of social transformation, gets better every year. “For me, it is always an honor to come here and visit the Institute. Seeing the children again, seeing the evolution of these children. I leave here once again with a smile on my face. Every time I come here it&#8217;s better. The ruler is always going up and the children are growing more and more”, he comments.</p>

<p>This Friday (24), Instituto Projeto Neymar Jr. was visited by Antonella Varbaro, Fleet Hotel &amp; HR Director at Costa Crociere and Solange Leal, Head of Human &amp; Facility for South America at Costa Cruises.</p>



<p>Accompanied by ISMBR representatives Carol Coelho, CEO of the company, and José Marcos Antillon, Recruitment Manager, Antonella and Solange were able to get to know the 8,400m2 structure up close and the work of inclusion and social transformation carried out by INJR. The visit ended in the auditorium, where more than 100 young people served by the project and candidates for crew in 2023 gathered to receive and talk to Costa Crociere representatives.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" onerror="this.src='https://www.institutoneymarjr.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-not-available.jpg'" src="https://www.institutoneymarjr.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_8466-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-16924" srcset="https://www.institutoneymarjr.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_8466-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.institutoneymarjr.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_8466-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.institutoneymarjr.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_8466-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.institutoneymarjr.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_8466-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.institutoneymarjr.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_8466-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>For Antonella Varbaro, the partnership with the project is a source of pride for Costa. “We are honored to have been selected to partner alongside other top companies. We are really committed and we really want to continue the partnership. It is a unique opportunity to really generate value for the people served and this is the most rewarding part of our work as a company”, she says.</p>



<p>The HR Director also says that the contact with the children was enriching. “For me, it was a very special day as a Costa representative. Spending just a few hours here, at the Institute, has enriched me a lot, not just as a professional, but as a person. I just wanted to express my gratitude for the invitation and for being part of this project as important as Instituto Neymar Jr. I am very grateful and very lucky to be part of this fantastic and unique project”, concludes Antonella.</p>

<p>The visit was led by Altamiro Bezerra, Financial Director of the INJR and, according to him, receiving Costa&#8217;s representatives was an honor. &#8220;Mrs. Antonella came from Italy especially to get to know the project and understand the project, because she has been with us for the last three years. In the first two groups that embarked and now we will have the third. She always participated via videoconference and, this time, she insisted on being present and getting to know the Institute&#8217;s facilities”, says Altamiro.</p>



<p>For Solange Leal, the day at the Institute was memorable. “For me it was a great emotion and a pleasure to be here because I had always heard about the Institute, but I didn&#8217;t know the structure. I am really impacted and moved to see the professionalism, dedication of the people involved and to see the face of our future crew”, she comments.</p>
